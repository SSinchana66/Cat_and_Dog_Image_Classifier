Cat and Dog Image Classifier using Data Science

This project is an image classifier built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as either cats or dogs.

Introduction

This project aims to classify images as either cats or dogs using deep learning techniques. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset consisting of thousands of cat and dog images. The model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes.


Requirements

    Python 3.7 or higher
    TensorFlow 2.5.0
    Keras 2.4.3
    NumPy 1.19.5
    Matplotlib 3.4.3

Dataset

We used the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset, which contains labeled images of cats and dogs. We split the dataset into training and testing sets, with 80% of the images used for training and 20% for testing.
